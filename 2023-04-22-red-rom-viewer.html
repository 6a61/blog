<p>I’ve been working on reverse engineering Pokémon Red and I’ve gotten
quite far! A lot of time went into it but also a lot of help. A big
shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/pret">pret</a> and their
dissassembly which was a great resource when it came to pin-pointing
where certain assets dwell in the ROM. I’m staying far away from how the
game actually works because… well, that’s for the future and a future
project, most likely!</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts was getting extracting the tilesets the game
uses and then rendering the whole map of the game. It wasn’t extremely
difficult and it was easy to see the fruits of my work.</p>
<p>The most difficult part was extracting the creatures’ sprites. They
are highly compressed (relatively speaking) and so they were quite
annoying to get right. But at the end of the day it was nothing that a
stubborn programmer couldn’t solve.</p>
<p>Right now, pretty much the whole graphics of the ROM can be
visualized. Some things can’t be easily visualized (again, due to
compression) but the data is there to be ordered, I just need to work on
it. One such example is the Gengar in the intro of the game.</p>

<p>On the programming side, the project was made using C++ and CMake for
building. As usual, my stack consists of SDL2, OpenGL and dear-imgui,
since I’m leveraging the knowledge acquired when working on my <a
href="2023-04-02-pistacchio.html"><em>Pistacchio</em> framework</a>.</p>
<p>Between the things that I’d like to tackle in the future, one is the
audio. Once I locate where it resides I’d have to work on an interpreter
or find a way to transform it in a modern audio format! Finding out how
the Game Boy did sound seems like an interesting project.</p>
<p>I’d also like to release the whole thing as an open-source project,
however I need to despaghettify the code and reorganize the files and
I’m quite lazy…</p>
<p>Also, music! <a
