<p>I’ve been working on a C++ framework for making real-time
applications for a while now, and it’s named <em>Pistacchio</em>, which
is the Italian word for (a single) pistachio. I know, quite mind
blowing.</p>
<p>However, after much studying I finally have something to show. Rise
and shine, <a

<p>It uses <a href="https://libsdl.org">SDL2</a> and OpenGL for OS
interaction and displaying graphics. Also, <a
href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> for the UI, since
it’s so easy to plug in and quite pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>My dream is that one day I’ll release the whole thing under an
open-source license, but I still have a bunch of things to do (and
projects to work on) before feeling comfortable enough to show it to the
public…</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things that I’m working on is adding
Vulkan support. And another special project that is quite dear to my
heart, which I don’t know if it’ll see the light of day (at least
<em>fully</em>, I do intend to release a part of it, sooner or
later).</p>
